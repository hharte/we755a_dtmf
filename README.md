# 755A PBX DTMF Converter


# Introduction

The Western Electric 755A PBX was designed in 1938 and supports pulse dialing only  This DTMF converter aims to add support for Touch Tone dialing.  One DTMF Converter board needs to be installed in each of the three links.  The converter recognizes DTMF digits, and sets the pulse counting relays in each link to their terminal count.

The dial plan for the 755A PBX consists of local station extensions 20-29 and 30-39.  Although this PBX supports four trunks, they are not dialable. Instead, key stations are used that have individual keys to select the trunks.

Here is an [introductory video of the 755A PBX in operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxt21lnzOqg).

This project builds upon the [OKI AC125A DTMF Converter](https://github.com/hharte/ac125a_dtmf) designed several years ago.  While the OKI is an electromechanical crossbar PBX similar in some ways to the 755A, the OKI is about 40 years more modern.


# Status

This board is currently being fabricated, but no firmware exists for it yet.  Additionally, the 755A employs 1930’s technology, so there are likely to be some challenges involved with installing modern digital circuitry into the PBX, primarily from EMI and large voltage transients caused by back-EMF generated by the electromechanical relays in the PBX.  It is anticipated that modern TVS circuitry will need to be installed in portions of the PBX in an attempt to suppress this enough to prevent damage to the solid-state relays used in this circuit, and also to prevent the microcontroller from going off into the weeds…
